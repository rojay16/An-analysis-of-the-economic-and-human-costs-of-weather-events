# An analysis of the economic and human costs of weather events

The report generated from the markdown file in this repository looks at the human and economic cost of storm data since 1950. The data is taken 
from the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) storm database. The report shows the the number of deaths and injuires assoicated
with each type of weather event (such as floods, hurricanes and tornados) as well the economic damage caused. This reports demonstates the preprocessing of data
in R, as well as the use of several R tools such as histograms, grouping, filtering and subsetting data.
